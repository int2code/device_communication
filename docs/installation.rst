Installation
============

Installation via PIP
--------------------


A typical way to install a package is to use the python package installer (`PIP`).
To install the package using the PIP personal token (github or other tool depending on
the artifactory server) with the `read_api` scope is required. Next, user needs to
create a `pip config file <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/>`_
to access artifactory server with the package.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install int2code-device-communication

To setup `pip.conf` follow one of the bellow accordingly to your package source:

    * `gitlab artifactory <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/pypi_repository/#install-a-pypi-package>`_
    * `azure feed <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/python/use-packages-from-pypi?view=azure-devops#authenticate-with-your-feed>`_


Editable install
----------------


For development, the package is usually installed as an `editable install`. To do this, 
in the root directory of the package the following command should be executed:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install -e .
 

Development version
-------------------

Sometimes a development package may be needed (e.g. so that it can be tested in a
CI environment as a dependency).

To release a dev package, add the suffix `.dev[xx]` to `version.txt`, where `xx` is the
consecutive package number, and run the `deploy_dev` pipeline to build and deploy the
package.

Example of dev version `version.txt` ``0.2.0.dev1``
